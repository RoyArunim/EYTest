There are 4 modules for each subpart of Part-1 of Assignment.  
Question 1 and Question 2 are variants of the same code so they are in Multithreading module.  
Question 3 :ADDING PRIORITY.  Created the priority queue from scratch and implemented the worker modules as per assignment.  
Question 4:BLOCKING QUEUES. Created blocking queues from scratch and implemented the Worker modules as per assignment question.  
Question 5: GETTING RESPONSES FROM WORKERS: Tuned the main thread to receive responses from workers and sum the log values.  

Part-2 of Assignment , I wasn't able to implement because I donot have knowledge about Directed Acyclic graphs or Manager worker design patterns. I have tried a lot but was unsuccessful in it.  

All the results of the code are recorded in the EY data.docx.
